I'll preface everything by saying that this blog is not for anyone else but for me. I envision this as a repository of my **ramblings**, and this can mean... 

<span style="color:grey">*Note: the list below is by no means exhaustive*</span>.

- rants
- short stories
- travel guides
- photos
- milestones
- etc...

I used to blog when I was a kid, primarily because my mom was an avid blogger. While it was not any good, I do remember enjoying it and I definitely think thats when I started to develop a basis for my writing. 

In that sense, this blog is a spiritual successor to that childhood pasttime. I will not link the old blog here, partly because I forgot where it is, and also because of the embarassment that might ensue. But good for you, if you find it.
 
I thought this would be a fun little project and something to look back on when I'm frail, old and forgetful and reminisce about the <span style="color:grey">*good old days*</span>.
